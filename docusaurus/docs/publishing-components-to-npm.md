Create React App doesn't provide any built-in functionality to publish a component to npm. If you're ready to extract a component from your project so other people can use it, we recommend moving it to a separate directory outside of your project and then using a tool like [nwb](https://github.com/insin/nwb#react-components-and-libraries) to prepare it for publishing.
