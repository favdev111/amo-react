Generally, we recommend that you donâ€™t reuse the same CSS classes across different components. For example, instead of using a `.Button` CSS class in `<AcceptButton>` and `<RejectButton>` components, we recommend creating a `<Button>` component with its own `.Button` styles, that both `<AcceptButton>` and `<RejectButton>` can render (but [not inherit](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html)).

Following this rule often makes CSS preprocessors less useful, as features like mixins and nesting are replaced by component composition. You can, however, integrate a CSS preprocessor if you find it valuable.

To use Sass, first install `node-sass`:

```bash
$ npm install node-sass --save
$ # or
$ yarn add node-sass
```

Now you can rename `src/App.css` to `src/App.scss` and update `src/App.js` to import `src/App.scss`.
This file and any other file will be automatically compiled if imported with the extension `.scss` or `.sass`.

To share variables between Sass files, you can use Sass imports. For example, `src/App.scss` and other component style files could include `@import "./shared.scss";` with variable definitions.

This will allow you to do imports like

```scss
@import 'styles/_colors.scss'; // assuming a styles directory under src/
@import '~nprogress/nprogress'; // importing a css file from the nprogress node module
```

> **Tip:** You can opt into using this feature with [CSS modules](adding-a-css-modules-stylesheet.md) too!

> **Note:** You must prefix imports from `node_modules` with `~` as displayed above.

> **Note:** If you're using Flow, add the following to your `.flowconfig` so it'll recognize the `.sass` or `.scss` imports.

> ```
> [options]
> module.file_ext=.sass
> module.file_ext=.scss
> ```
