### Global CLI (`create-react-app`)

* It enforces that you have Node >= 4 ([@conorhastings](https://github.com/conorhastings) in [#88](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/88))
* It handles `--version` flag correctly ([@mxstbr](https://github.com/mxstbr) in [#152](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/152))

### Migrating from 0.1.0 to 0.2.0

You may optionally update the global command (itâ€™s not required):

```
npm install -g create-react-app@0.2.0
```

Inside any created project that has not been ejected, run:

```
npm install --save-dev --save-exact react-scripts@0.2.0
```

You may need to fix a few lint warnings about missing `<img alt>` tag, but everything else should work out of the box. If you intend to deploy your site to GitHub Pages, you may now [add `homepage` field to `package.json`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/template/README.md#deploy-to-github-pages). If you had [issues with integrating editor linter plugins](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/124), follow [these new instructions](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/template/README.md#display-lint-output-in-the-editor).
