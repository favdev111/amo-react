## 0.4.1 (September 3, 2016)

### Build Dependency (`react-scripts`)

* We now support (but [don’t recommend](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/87#issuecomment-234627904)) `.jsx` file extension. ([@tizmagik](https://github.com/tizmagik) in [#563](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/563))
* Proxy request errors are now printed to the console. ([@cloudmu](https://github.com/cloudmu) in [#502](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/502))

### Migrating from 0.4.0 to 0.4.1

Inside any created project that has not been ejected, run:

```
npm install --save-dev --save-exact react-scripts@0.4.1
```

## 0.4.0 (September 2, 2016)

### Build Dependency (`react-scripts`)

* **Breaking Change:** Disabled implicit serving of source files in development. ([@gaearon](https://github.com/gaearon) in [#551](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/551))
* You can use `NODE_PATH` environment variable for absolute `import` paths. ([@jimmyhmiller](https://github.com/jimmyhmiller) in [#476](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/476))
* If `src/setupTests.js` exists, it will be used to setup the test environment. ([@gaelduplessix](https://github.com/gaelduplessix) in [#548](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/548))
* If `HTTPS` environment variable is set to `true`, development server will run in HTTPS mode. ([@dceddia](https://github.com/dceddia) in [#552](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/552))

### Migrating from 0.3.1 to 0.4.0

Inside any created project that has not been ejected, run:

```
npm install --save-dev --save-exact react-scripts@0.4.0
```

### Breaking Change in 0.4.0

Paths like `/src/somefile.png` used to be served in development, but only by accident. They never worked in production builds. Since 0.4.0, we [don’t serve static files by default in development anymore either](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/551). This removes a dangerous inconsistency that we never intentionally supported.

If you need a static file to be part for the build, [import it from JavaScript and you will get its filename](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/template/README.md#adding-images-and-fonts). This ensures it gets included into the production build as well, and its filename contains the content hash.

If you used static files with `<link href>`, [read this new guide](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/template/README.md#referring-to-static-assets-from-link-href) on how to make sure these files get included into the builds. For example, you can replace `<link href="/src/favicons/favicon-32.png">` with `<link href="./src/favicons/favicon-32.png">`, and then Webpack will recognize it and include it into the build.

If you referenced some other files from `index.html`, please file an issue to discuss your use case. In the meantime, you can serve them from a separate static server until your use case is supported.

## 0.3.1 (September 2, 2016)

### Build Dependency (`react-scripts`)

### Migrating from 0.3.0 to 0.3.1

Inside any created project that has not been ejected, run:

```
npm install --save-dev --save-exact react-scripts@0.3.1
```

## 0.3.0 (September 1, 2016)

### Build Dependency (`react-scripts`)

* Testing is [now supported](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/template/README.md#running-tests)! ([Jest project contributors](https://github.com/facebook/jest/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed), [@cpojer](https://github.com/cpojer) in [#250](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/250), [@gaearon](https://github.com/gaearon) in [#378](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/378), [#530](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/530), [#533](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/533))
* Static files such as CSS, images, and fonts, can now exist outside `src` directory. ([@fson](https://github.com/fson) in [#504](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/504))
* **Breaking Change:** Local paths in `<link href>` in `index.html` will now be correctly resolved, so deleting `favicon.ico` is not an error anymore. ([@andreypopp](https://github.com/andreypopp) in [#428](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/428))
* Removed an annoying lint rule that warned for `<div ref={node => this.node = node}>`. ([@mrscobbler](https://github.com/mrscobbler) in [#529](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/529))
* Temporarily disabled `react-constant-elements` Babel transform because of its bugs. ([@gaearon](https://github.com/gaearon) in [#534](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/534))
* Fixed a permission issue with Docker. ([@gaearon](https://github.com/gaearon) in [73c940](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/commit/73c940a73205d761230f8d6bf81ecfd460ba28a9))

### Migrating from 0.2.3 to 0.3.0

You may optionally update the global command (it’s not required):

```
npm install -g create-react-app@0.3.0
```

Inside any created project that has not been ejected, run:

```
npm install --save-dev --save-exact react-scripts@0.3.0
```

#### Breaking Change

Now `favicon.ico` is not treated specially anymore.  
If you use it, move it to `src` and add the following line to `<head>` in your HTML:

```html
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="./src/favicon.ico">
```

#### New Feature

Since 0.3.0 added a test runner, we recommend that you add it to the `scripts` section of your `package.json` like this:

```js
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    // ...
    "test": "react-scripts test --env=jsdom"
  }
```

[Then read the testing guide to learn more about using it!](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/template/README.md#running-tests)

### Migrating from 0.2.2 to 0.2.3

Update `react-scripts` to point to `0.2.3` in your `package.json` and run `npm install`. You shouldn’t need to do anything else.

Newly created projects will use `0.2.3` automatically. You **don’t** need to update the global `create-react-app` CLI itself. It stays at `0.2.0` for now because it doesn’t have any changes.

## 0.2.2 (August 22, 2016)

### Build Dependency (`react-scripts`)

### Migrating from 0.1.0 to 0.2.0

You may optionally update the global command (it’s not required):

```
npm install -g create-react-app@0.2.0
```

Inside any created project that has not been ejected, run:

```
npm install --save-dev --save-exact react-scripts@0.2.0
```

You may need to fix a few lint warnings about missing `<img alt>` tag, but everything else should work out of the box. If you intend to deploy your site to GitHub Pages, you may now [add `homepage` field to `package.json`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/template/README.md#deploy-to-github-pages).
