### Migrating from 0.4.3 to 0.5.0

Inside any created project that has not been ejected, run:

```
npm install --save-dev --save-exact react-scripts@0.5.0
```

### Breaking Changes in 0.5.0

#### Global ESLint Plugin Versions

If you used a global ESLint installation for the editor integration, you’ll need to install [these versions of global ESLint packages](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/c092086b1b256fd081f10744f90d216dd5217e29/packages/eslint-config-react-app/package.json#L14-L19).

#### Moving `index.html` into `public` Folder

You’ll also need to create a new folder called `public` in the root of your project. Then, move `index.html` and files it references (such as a favicon) into that folder.

You can no longer reference any files from `./src` in `index.html`. Instead, `public/index.html` can now only reference files other inside of the `public` folder using a special variable called `%PUBLIC_URL%`.

For example, instead of:

```js
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="./src/favicon.ico">
```

You would need to move both `index.html` and `src/favicon.ico` into the `public` folder, and change `<link>` to look like this:

```html
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico">
```

This ensures it become a part of the build output, and resolves correctly both with client-side routing and non-root `homepage` in `package.json`. Read more about [using the `public` folder](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#using-the-public-folder) and [why these changes were made](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/703).

```
npm install --save-dev --save-exact react-scripts@0.4.3
```

## 0.4.2 (September 18, 2016)

### Build Dependency (`react-scripts`)

* Lint output in editor is now opt-in because, due to [this ESLint issue](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/3458), it is broken by default in Atom. ([@fson](https://github.com/fson) in [#649](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/649))
* Fixes an issue causing compile errors when project folder is inside a symlink. ([@motiz88](https://github.com/motiz88) in [#648](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/648))

### Global CLI (`create-react-app`)

* It now runs on early Node versions to print a friendly warning instead of crashing. ([@sotojuan](https://github.com/sotojuan) in [fc3ab4](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/commit/fc3ab46d2a54f142f9287ce7de9ab2fc2514487d))
* We now print a friendly message when you create a project with invalid name. ([@mareksuscak](https://github.com/mareksuscak) in [#628](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/628))
* Passing a custom fork of `react-scripts` to `create-react-app` with `--scripts-version` works again. ([@yesmeck](https://github.com/yesmeck) in [#632](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/632))

### Migrating from 0.4.1 to 0.4.2

You may optionally update the global command (it’s not required):

```
npm install -g create-react-app@0.4.2
```

Inside any created project that has not been ejected, run:

```
npm install --save-dev --save-exact react-scripts@0.4.2
```

## 0.4.1 (September 3, 2016)

### Build Dependency (`react-scripts`)

* We now support (but [don’t recommend](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/87#issuecomment-234627904)) `.jsx` file extension. ([@tizmagik](https://github.com/tizmagik) in [#563](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/563))
* Proxy request errors are now printed to the console. ([@cloudmu](https://github.com/cloudmu) in [#502](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/502))

### Migrating from 0.4.0 to 0.4.1

Inside any created project that has not been ejected, run:

```
npm install --save-dev --save-exact react-scripts@0.4.1
```

## 0.4.0 (September 2, 2016)

### Build Dependency (`react-scripts`)

* **Breaking Change:** Disabled implicit serving of source files in development. ([@gaearon](https://github.com/gaearon) in [#551](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/551))
* You can use `NODE_PATH` environment variable for absolute `import` paths. ([@jimmyhmiller](https://github.com/jimmyhmiller) in [#476](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/476))
* If `src/setupTests.js` exists, it will be used to setup the test environment. ([@gaelduplessix](https://github.com/gaelduplessix) in [#548](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/548))
* If `HTTPS` environment variable is set to `true`, development server will run in HTTPS mode. ([@dceddia](https://github.com/dceddia) in [#552](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/552))

### Migrating from 0.3.1 to 0.4.0

Inside any created project that has not been ejected, run:

```
npm install --save-dev --save-exact react-scripts@0.4.0
```

### Breaking Change in 0.4.0

Paths like `/src/somefile.png` used to be served in development, but only by accident. They never worked in production builds. Since 0.4.0, we [don’t serve static files by default in development anymore either](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/551). This removes a dangerous inconsistency that we never intentionally supported.

If you need a static file to be part for the build, [import it from JavaScript and you will get its filename](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/template/README.md#adding-images-and-fonts). This ensures it gets included into the production build as well, and its filename contains the content hash.

If you used static files with `<link href>`, [read this new guide](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/template/README.md#referring-to-static-assets-from-link-href) on how to make sure these files get included into the builds. For example, you can replace `<link href="/src/favicons/favicon-32.png">` with `<link href="./src/favicons/favicon-32.png">`, and then Webpack will recognize it and include it into the build.

If you referenced some other files from `index.html`, please file an issue to discuss your use case. In the meantime, you can serve them from a separate static server until your use case is supported.

## 0.3.1 (September 2, 2016)

### Build Dependency (`react-scripts`)

* Bumps Jest dependency to fix a few issues discovered yesterday. ([@cpojer](https://github.com/cpojer) in [facebook/jest#1580](https://github.com/facebook/jest/pull/1580), [@insin](https://github.com/insin) in [facebook/jest#1574](https://github.com/facebook/jest/pull/1574))

([Jest project contributors](https://github.com/facebook/jest/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed), [@cpojer](https://github.com/cpojer) in [#250](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/250), [@gaearon](https://github.com/gaearon) in [#378](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/378), [#530](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/530), [#533](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/533))
* Static files such as CSS, images, and fonts, can now exist outside `src` directory. ([@fson](https://github.com/fson) in [#504](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/504))
* **Breaking Change:** Local paths in `<link href>` in `index.html` will now be correctly resolved, so deleting `favicon.ico` is not an error anymore. ([@andreypopp](https://github.com/andreypopp) in [#428](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/428))
* Removed an annoying lint rule that warned for `<div ref={node => this.node = node}>`. ([@mrscobbler](https://github.com/mrscobbler) in [#529](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/529))
* Temporarily disabled `react-constant-elements` Babel transform because of its bugs. ([@gaearon](https://github.com/gaearon) in [#534](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/534))
* Fixed a permission issue with Docker. ([@gaearon](https://github.com/gaearon) in [73c940](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/commit/73c940a73205d761230f8d6bf81ecfd460ba28a9))
* Fixed an issue with generator syntax in Jest that occurred in an alpha release. ([@gaearon](https://github.com/gaearon) in [#535](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/535))

### Global CLI (`create-react-app`)

* You can now create a project in a folder that already contains an `.idea` folder, which is necessary for future WebStorm integration. ([@denofevil](https://github.com/denofevil) in [#522](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/522))

### Migrating from 0.2.3 to 0.3.0

You may optionally update the global command (it’s not required):

```
npm install -g create-react-app@0.3.0
```

Inside any created project that has not been ejected, run:

```
npm install --save-dev --save-exact react-scripts@0.3.0
```

#### Breaking Change

Now `favicon.ico` is not treated specially anymore.  
If you use it, move it to `src` and add the following line to `<head>` in your HTML:

```html
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="./src/favicon.ico">
```

#### New Feature

Since 0.3.0 added a test runner, we recommend that you add it to the `scripts` section of your `package.json` like this:

```js
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    // ...
    "test": "react-scripts test --env=jsdom"
  }
```

[Then read the testing guide to learn more about using it!](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/template/README.md#running-tests)

## 0.2.3 (August 25, 2016)

### Build Dependency (`react-scripts`)

* You can now [proxy requests to an API server](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/ef94b0561d5afb9b50b905fa5cd3f94e965c69c0/template/README.md#proxying-api-requests-in-development) without worrying about CORS.

Update `react-scripts` to point to `0.2.3` in your `package.json` and run `npm install`. You shouldn’t need to do anything else.

Newly created projects will use `0.2.3` automatically. You **don’t** need to update the global `create-react-app` CLI itself. It stays at `0.2.0` for now because it doesn’t have any changes.

## 0.2.2 (August 22, 2016)

### Build Dependency (`react-scripts`)

### Migrating from 0.2.1 to 0.2.2

Update `react-scripts` to point to `0.2.2` in your `package.json` and run `npm install`. You shouldn’t need to do anything else.

Newly created projects will use `0.2.2` automatically. You **don’t** need to update the global `create-react-app` CLI itself. It stays at `0.2.0` for now because it doesn’t have any changes.

## 0.2.1 (August 1, 2016)

### Build Dependency (`react-scripts`)

* Fixes an issue with `npm start` taking a very long time on OS X with Firewall enabled ([@gaearon](https://github.com/gaearon) in [#319](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/319))
* Fixes an issue with Webpack eating a lot of CPU in some cases ([@dceddia](https://github.com/dceddia) in [#294](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/294))
* We now warn if you import a file with mismatched casing because this breaks the watcher ([@alexzherdev](https://github.com/alexzherdev) in [#266](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/266))

Update `react-scripts` to point to `0.2.1` in your `package.json` and run `npm install`. You shouldn’t need to do anything else. If you see a warning about wrong file casing next time you `npm start`, fix your imports to use the correct filename casing.

Newly created projects will use `0.2.1` automatically. You **don’t** need to update the global `create-react-app` CLI itself. It stays at `0.2.0` for now because it doesn’t have any changes.

## 0.2.0 (July 28, 2016)

### Build Dependency (`react-scripts`)

* It enforces that you have Node >= 4 ([@conorhastings](https://github.com/conorhastings) in [#88](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/88))

### Migrating from 0.1.0 to 0.2.0

You may optionally update the global command (it’s not required):

```
npm install -g create-react-app@0.2.0
```

Inside any created project that has not been ejected, run:

```
npm install --save-dev --save-exact react-scripts@0.2.0
```

You may need to fix a few lint warnings about missing `<img alt>` tag, but everything else should work out of the box. If you intend to deploy your site to GitHub Pages, you may now [add `homepage` field to `package.json`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/template/README.md#deploy-to-github-pages). If you had [issues with integrating editor linter plugins](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/124), follow [these new instructions](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/template/README.md#display-lint-output-in-the-editor).
